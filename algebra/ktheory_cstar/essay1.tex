\section{Introduction}

\noindent \emph{This essay was written for the Fall 2023 session of MAT437 at the University of Toronto.}
\newline

\noindent The goal of this essay is to introduce, explain, and place in broader context some basic results in the theory of $C^{*}$-dynamical systems.

\begin{comment}
\begin{theorem}[Atiyah-Singer index theorem]
  For an elliptic differential operator on a compact manifold, the analytical index is equal to the topological index.
\end{theorem}

\section{Building up to the index theorem}

\noindent The main goal of this section of the essay is to develop the necessary machinery in order to understand each individual concept utilized in the statement of the index
theorem. At a coarse-grained level, this will involve defining \emph{elliptic differential operators}, \emph{analytical index}, and \emph{topological index}. The first of these concepts
is simple.

\begin{definition}[Elliptic differential operator]
  We let $D$ be an order-$m$ differential operator on domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$, given by $Du = \sum_{|a| \leq m} f_{\alpha}(x) \partial^{\alpha} u$, where $u \in C^{\infty}(\Omega, \mathbb{R})$,
  where $\alpha = (\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n)$ with $\alpha_1 + \cdots + \alpha_n = m$ and $\partial^{\alpha} = \partial_1^{\alpha_1} \cdots \partial_{n}^{\alpha_n}$. The operator $D$ is said to be \emph{elliptic}
  if for every $x \in \Omega$ and non-zero $y \in \mathbb{R}$,
  \begin{equation}
    \displaystyle\sum_{\alpha = |m|} f_{\alpha}(x) y^{\alpha_1} \cdots y^{\alpha_n} \neq 0.
    \end{equation}
\end{definition}

\noindent As for the two notions of ``index'': these ideas are much more subtle and require substantial exposition.
\end{comment}

\section{Basic definitions}

\noindent The primary ingredient in any kind of homological theory is an \emph{exact sequence}.

\begin{definition}[Exact sequence]
  A sequence of objects $\mathcal{O}_n$ and morphisms $f_n$ of some category, arranged such that
  $f_{n + 1} : \mathcal{O}_{n + 1} \rightarrow \mathcal{O}_{n}$ is said to be exact at $\mathcal{O}_n$
  when $\text{Im}(f_{n + 1}) = \text{Ker}(f_n)$. A sequence is exact if it is exact at all objects. A sequence
  is said to be \emph{short exact}, if it is exact and of the form
  \begin{equation}

    \end{equation}
  \end{definition}

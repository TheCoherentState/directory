\section{Introduction}

\noindent \emph{This essay was written for the Fall 2023 session of MAT437 at the University of Toronto.}
\newline

\noindent The goal of this essay is to introduce, explain, and place in broader context the basic theory of cyclic cohomology. The main reference
for this essay is the book by Moriyoshi and Natsume (Ref.~\cite{}). This book provides a brief introduction to non-commutative geometry: we attempt
to expand upon some of their main points in this work.

\section{Motivation and background}

\subsection{Trace maps}

\noindent The $K_0$-group of a $C^{*}$-algebra $A$ is a broadly powerful invariant which encodes the underlying structure of $A$, in such a way that lends
itself well to being analyzed via a large toolbox of different techniques. Amonng such techniques are extracting numerical invariants from $K_0(A)$ via \emph{trace maps}.

\begin{definition}[Trace map on a $C^{*}$-algebra]
\end{definition}

\noindent Using the functoriality of $K_0$, it is possible to then obtain a trace map $K_o(\tau) : K_0(A) \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$.

\begin{claim}[Induced trace map]
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
  \end{proof}

\noindent Trace maps of this form are vital to the analysis of $K_0$-groups. However, as it turns out, one will often encounter $C^{*}$-algebras which \emph{admit no non-trivial trace}.

\subsection{A brief aside: the Cuntz algebra}



\begin{comment}
\begin{theorem}[Atiyah-Singer index theorem]
  For an elliptic differential operator on a compact manifold, the analytical index is equal to the topological index.
\end{theorem}

\section{Building up to the index theorem}

\noindent The main goal of this section of the essay is to develop the necessary machinery in order to understand each individual concept utilized in the statement of the index
theorem. At a coarse-grained level, this will involve defining \emph{elliptic differential operators}, \emph{analytical index}, and \emph{topological index}. The first of these concepts
is simple.

\begin{definition}[Elliptic differential operator]
  We let $D$ be an order-$m$ differential operator on domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$, given by $Du = \sum_{|a| \leq m} f_{\alpha}(x) \partial^{\alpha} u$, where $u \in C^{\infty}(\Omega, \mathbb{R})$,
  where $\alpha = (\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n)$ with $\alpha_1 + \cdots + \alpha_n = m$ and $\partial^{\alpha} = \partial_1^{\alpha_1} \cdots \partial_{n}^{\alpha_n}$. The operator $D$ is said to be \emph{elliptic}
  if for every $x \in \Omega$ and non-zero $y \in \mathbb{R}$,
  \begin{equation}
    \displaystyle\sum_{\alpha = |m|} f_{\alpha}(x) y^{\alpha_1} \cdots y^{\alpha_n} \neq 0.
    \end{equation}
\end{definition}

\noindent As for the two notions of ``index'': these ideas are much more subtle and require substantial exposition.
\end{comment}

\begin{comment}
\noindent The primary ingredient in any kind of homological theory is an \emph{exact sequence}.

\begin{definition}[Exact sequence]
  A sequence of objects $\mathcal{O}_n$ and morphisms $f_n$ of some category, arranged such that
  $f_{n + 1} : \mathcal{O}_{n + 1} \rightarrow \mathcal{O}_{n}$ is said to be exact at $\mathcal{O}_n$
  when $\text{Im}(f_{n + 1}) = \text{Ker}(f_n)$. A sequence is exact if it is exact at all objects. A sequence
  is said to be \emph{short exact}, if it is exact and of the form
\end{definition}

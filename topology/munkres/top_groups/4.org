Clearly, both of these maps are continuous, as they are restrictions of continuous maps. Moreover, we can easily write down their inverses

$$f_{\alpha}^{-1}(x) = \alpha^{-1} \cdot x \ \ \ \text{and} \ \ \ g_{\alpha}^{-1}(x) = x \cdot \alpha^{-1}$$.

Both are obviously continuous, via the same logic. The fact that $G$ is homogeneous comes from the fact that given $x$, we can write down homeomorphism $f_{y \cdot x^{-1}}$, where
$f_{y \cdot x^{-1}}(x) = y$.

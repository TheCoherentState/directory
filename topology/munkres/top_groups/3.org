Clearly, if $H$ is a subgroup/subspace of $G$, then the multiplication and inversion operations restricted to it are automatically well-defined and continuous.

As for $\overline{H}$, note that $\overline{H}$ clearly satisfies the $T_1$ axiom, and the restrictions of of the product/inverse to this domain will be continuous. We simply need
to demonstrate that elements of $\overline{H}$ are mapped to elements of $\overline{H}$ (i.e. that it is a subgroup). This follows from the fact that

$$\cdot(\overline{H}, \overline{H}) = \cdot(\overline{H \times H}) \subset \overline{\cdot(H \times H)} = \overline{H}$$

with a similar proof showing the inverse is also closed.

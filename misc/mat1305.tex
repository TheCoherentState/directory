\section{Problem 1}

\noindent Note that
\begin{equation}
  |z + w|^2 = (z + w)^{*} (z + w) = z^{*} z + w^{*} z + z^{*} w + w^{*} w = (w^{*} z + z^{*} w) + |z|^2 + |w|^2,
\end{equation}
where distributitivity of the conjugation operation over addition is trivial to demonstrate. This equation also implies upon $w \mapsto -w$,
we have $|z - w|^2 = -(w^{*} z + z^{*} w) + |z|^2 + |w|^2$, where commutativity of scalar multiplication and conjugation is also trivial to show.
Thus, we have the desired equality via cancellation,
\begin{equation}
  |z + w|^2 + |z - w|^2 = 2(|z|^2 + |w|^2).
\end{equation}
Geometrically, we know that addition of complex numbers in $\mathbb{C}$ can be thought of as ``geometric'' vector addition in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Think of $z$
and $w$ as vectors in $\mathbb{R}^2$: these vectors define a triangle in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with vertices at $(0, 0)$, $z + w$, and $z - w$. Let
$\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$ be the standard inner product on $\mathbb{R}^2$, note that $\langle z + w, z - w \rangle = |z|^2 + |w|^2$. Also recall that for $a, b \in \mathbb{R}^2$,
$\langle a, b \rangle = |a| |b| \cos(\theta)$, where $\cos(\theta)$ is the standard angle between the vectors. Therefore,

\begin{align}
  |z + w|^2 + |z - w|^2 &= 2 (|z|^2 + |w|^2) = 2 \langle z + w, z - w \rangle
  \\ &\Longleftrightarrow |z + w|^2 + |z - w|^2 = 2 |z + w| |z - w| \cos(\theta)
\end{align}
where $\cos(\theta)$ is the angle between $z + w$ and $z - w$. Hence, the formula proved is just the standard \emph{cosine law} of trigonometry is disguise (this
is the best geometric interpretation I can conjure). See below for a diagram.

\section{Problem 2}

\section{Problem 5}

Let $f(z) = \frac{az + b}{cz + d}$ be a fractional linear transformation. Suppose $f$ preserves $\mathbb{R} \times \{0\} \subset \mathbb{C} \simeq \mathbb{R}^2$.

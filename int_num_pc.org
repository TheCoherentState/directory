Algebraic intersection theory is very nice because of its rigidity (unlike the analogous topological intersection theory). As it turns out, one can
define an intersection number of affine plane curves which has all of the desirable properties that one would expect of an "intersection number" purely
via the algebraic properties of rational functions defined on the curves.

To be more specific, given affine plane curves $F$ and $G$ in $\mathbb{A}^2(k)$ (where $k$ is an algebraically closed field) and $P \in \mathbb{A}^2(k)$, the
/intersection number/ of $F$ and $G$ and $P$, denoted $I(F \cap G, P)$, is the unique map on triples $(F, G, P)$ to $\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0} \cup \{\infty\}$ which
satisfies the following properties:

1. $I(F \cap G, P) = \infty$ if and only if $F$ and $G$ have a common component passing through $P$. $I(F \cap G, P) = 0$ if and only if $F$ and $G$ do not intersect at $P$.
2. $I(F \cap G, P)$ only depends on the irreducible components of $F$ and $G$ which pass through $P$.
3. If $T$ is an affine change of coordinates, then $I(F \circ T \cap G \circ T, P) = I(F \cap G, T(P))$.
4. $I(F \cap G, P) = I(G \cap F, P)$
5. $I(F \cap G, P) \geq m_P(F) m_P(G)$, where $m_P$ is the multiplicity at $P$, and equality occurs if and only if $F$ and $G$ share no common tangent lines at $P$.
6. If $F = \prod_{i} F_i$ and $G = \prod_{j} G_j$, then $I(F \cap G, P) = \sum_{ij} I(F_i, \cap G_j, P)$.
7. For any $A \in k[X, Y]$, $I(F \cap G, P) = I(F \cap (G + AF), P)$.

I'm doing some thinking today about quantum field theory. I'm starting off by reading Witten's paper
on topological QFT. Here are a few thoughts:

- He makes a few interesting claims about the "atlas" which maps between physics and differential geometry.
  In particular, he states that the Hamiltonian corresponding to a classical particle moving on a Riemannian manifold
  is the Laplace-Beltrami operator, which does make sense, as the Hamiltonian corresponding to a free particle in $n$ -dimensional Euclidean
  space is of course just of the form $H = \frac{1}{2m} \Delta$.

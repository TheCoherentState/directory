Welcome to the math diary of Jack Ceroni. The goal of this project is to create a place on the Internet where
I'm able to write down thoughts I have on books/papers I'm reading, without actually doing a lengthy, edited, formal
writeup. I think that oftentimes, it is easy for good ideas/good intuition to pass us by when we don't record it. I'm
hoping to break this cycle.

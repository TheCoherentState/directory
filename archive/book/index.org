* Introduction

  Welcome to my work-in-progress book on differential geometry and topology. I will keep this page updated with the different sections
  as I construct them.

* Chapters

** Part 0: Topology crash-course

- [[./part0/pdf/quotient.pdf][The quotient topology]]

** Part 1: Basics of differential geometry

- Manifolds, maps between manifolds
- Tangent space and the tangent bundle
- Differential forms
- Integration on manifolds, Stokes' theorem

** Part 2: Algebraic topology and differential geometry

- [[./part2/pdf/homotopy.pdf][Homotopy and homotopy type]]
- [[./part2/cw_complex.html][CW-complexes]]

** Part 3: Riemannian geometry

** Part 4: Complex geometry

** Part 5: Basic algebraic geometry

** Part 6: Applications to physics

** Part 7: Current topics in geometry

   /The goal of this section is to outline current research topics in differential geometry/

* Introducing curves on surfaces

  Let us begin with a discussion of curves on surfaces.

  *Definition (Curve).* Let $\Sigma$ be an orientable compact surface possible with boundary. We define a curve on $\Sigma$ as a map $\alpha : S^1 \rightarrow \Sigma$.
  We call curve $\alpha$ /simple/ if it is non-trivial (that is, $\alpha$ is not nullhomotopic), it is not free homotopic to a boundary component of the surface, and is injective.

  *Definition (Curve system).* Let $\Sigma$ be an orientable compact surface possibly with boundary. A curve system $\Gamma$ of $\Sigma$ is a collection of simple
  curves on $\Sigma$ which are pairwise non-homotopic.

  This definition allows for us to write down (yet another) definition of the genus of a surface.

  *Definition (Genus).* Given a surface $\Sigma$ (compact, orientable, possibly with boundary), we define the genus $g(\Sigma)$ to be the maximum size of a non-separating
  curve system. That is, a curve system $\Gamma$ such that $\Sigma - \sqcup_{\gamma \in \Gamma} \gamma$ is connected.

  With this, let us now recall a deep result which classifies all orientable, compact surfaces.

  ------------------

  *Theorem (Surface classification).* Let $\Sigma$ and $\Sigma'$ be surfaces. Let $b(\Pi)$ denote the number of boundary components of $\Pi$ (the connected components of $\partial \Pi$). Then $g(\Sigma) = g(\Sigma')$ and $b(\Sigma) = b(\Sigma')$
  if and only if $\Sigma$ is homeomorphic to $\Sigma'$. Moreover, given homeomorphic surfaces $\Sigma$ and $\Sigma'$, as well as a homeomorphism $f : \partial\Sigma \rightarrow \partial \Sigma'$, there exists a homeomorphism $F : \Sigma \rightarrow \Sigma'$
  such that $F|_{\partial \Sigma} = f$.

  This a deep and fundamental result in algebraic topology. For a proof of this result, see my writings on algebraic topology (currently in progress), or Munkres' text.

  ------------------

  Suppose are given a surface $\Sigma$ of genus $g = g(\Sigma)$ and boundary number $b = b(\Sigma)$, let $\Sigma_g$ be the connected sum of $g$ tori, $T^2 \ \# \ \cdots \ \# \ T^2$.
  Let $\phi_1, \dots, \phi_b$ be maps $\phi_k : B^2 \rightarrow \Sigma_g$ such that each $\phi_k$ embeds the open ball $B^2$ in $\Sigma_g$ and $\phi_j(B^2) \cap \phi_k(B^2) = \emptyset$
  for $j \neq k$. Let $\Sigma_0 = \Sigma_g - (\phi_1(B^2) \sqcup \cdots \sqcup \phi_b(B^2))$. This is clearly a compact, orientable surface with boundary. It has genus $g$ and $b$ boundary components.

  It follows from the classification theorem that $\Sigma \simeq \Sigma_0$. Thus, when thinking about surface $\Sigma$, it will often be helpful to instead, without loss of generality,
  consider $\Sigma_0$, of which we can construct a nice mental picture.

  --------------------

  Let us now return to understanding the behaviour of curve systems. Of course, a surface can have many curve systems, so a natural next question for us to ask is:
  /how many such curve systems can we find on a surface, up to free homotopy?/ Take $\Sigma_0$ as defined above. Without loss of generality, we can assume that there is a region of $\Sigma_0$ which looks something like this,
  with simple curves $\alpha$ and $\beta$:

  Our goal is to answer the following question: /does there exist a homeomorphism which takes $\alpha$ to $\beta$?/ As it turns out, the answer to this question is *yes*, and it follows directly from the surface classification theorem.

  ---------------------

  *Theorem.* Given a surface $\Sigma$ of genus $g \geq 1$ and curves $\alpha$ and $\beta$ of the form in the above diagram (existence of such curves up to homeomorphism is guaranteed by the fact that they exist in $\Sigma_0$
  constructed above), there exists an auto-homeomorphism of $\Sigma$ which sends $\alpha$ to $\beta$.

  /Proof./ Without loss of generality, we can assume $\Sigma = \Sigma_0$. Consider the subsets of $\Sigma_0$ given by
  \begin{equation}
  \Sigma_{\alpha} = \Sigma_0 - \alpha = (T^2 - \alpha) \ \# \ \cdots \ \# \ T^2 - (\phi_1(B^2) \sqcup \cdots \sqcup \phi_b(B^2))
  \end{equation}
  as well as
  \begin{equation}
  \Sigma_{\beta} = \Sigma_0 - \beta = (T^2 - \beta) \ \# \ \cdots \ \# \ T^2 - (\phi_1(B^2) \sqcup \cdots \sqcup \phi_b(B^2))
  \end{equation}
  where the embedded disks are assumed, without loss of generality, to be disjoint from the curves $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Clearly, $T^2 - \alpha \simeq S^1 \times [0, 1]$, and
  with a bit more thought, it is easy to conclude that $T^2 - \beta \simeq S^1 \times [0, 1]$ as well.

  [[./assets/lecture1_2.jpeg]]

  Thus, $\Sigma_{\alpha} \simeq \Sigma_{\beta}$ (for elaboration on why this holds for spaces constructed via the connected sum, see [[./lecture0.html][Lecture 0]]).

  We know from the classification of one-dimension manifolds that any one-dimensional compact manifold without boundary is a
  disjoint union of circles. Thus, since $\partial \Sigma_{\alpha}$ and $\partial \Sigma_{\beta}$ are compact manifolds without boundary, they will be a disjoint union of the same number of circles.
  It follows that we can choose a homeomorphism of $\partial \Sigma_{\alpha}$ to $\partial \Sigma_{\beta}$, sending the two boundary components produced by slicing $\alpha$ to the two boundary components produced by slicing $\beta$.

  We then use the second part of
  the surface classification result to extend this to a homeomorphism $\varphi$ from $\Sigma_{\alpha}$ to $\Sigma_{\beta}$, which also has this property of sending the $\alpha$ -boundary to the $\beta$ -boundary. We then re-construct the original surface
  $\Sigma_0$ by taking the closures of $\Sigma_{\alpha}$ and $\Sigma_{\beta}$ in $\Sigma_0$, both of which produce the whole space $\Sigma_0$. The unique induced auto-homeomorphism on the closures, produced from $\varphi$, will have the property that it sends $\alpha$ to $\beta$.

 *(J): This section may be subject to some changes. This proof doesn't really say anything about preserving orientation*

* Classifying all simple curves on a surface

   *Remark.* The final result of the previous section suggests that we can classify the simple curves lying on $\Sigma$. Given two curves $\gamma$ and $\xi$ on a surface, it follows from
   a similar argument to above that if $\Sigma - \gamma$ and $\Sigma - \xi$ produce surfaces of the same type, then the two curves are of the same homeomorphism class.
   Thus, a natural question for us to ask is: /how many such homeomorphism classes of curves exist?/

   ---------------------

   *Corollary.* Two curves $\gamma$ and $\xi$ on a surface $\Sigma$ of type $(g, b)$ are of the same homeomorphism class if and only if $\Sigma - \gamma$ and $\Sigma - \xi$ are of the
   same type.

   /Proof./ If $\Sigma - \gamma$ and $\Sigma - \xi$ are of the same type, the proof is the same as above. If $\gamma$ and $\xi$ are of the same homeomorphism class, then there
   exists homeomorphism $\varphi : \Sigma \rightarrow \Sigma$ such that $\varphi(\gamma) = \xi$. Then $\varphi |_{\Sigma - \gamma} : \Sigma - \gamma \rightarrow \Sigma - \xi$ is a homeomorphism,
   so the surfaces are of the same type.

   *Theorem.* All non-separating curves of a type- $(g, b)$ surface are in the same homeomorphism class.

   /Proof./ Slicing along any simple curve $\gamma$ will yield two new boundary components. (*(J): This is intuitively true, but can we justify it better?*)
   Since $\gamma$ is non-separating, we can extend it to a maximal non-separating curve system (*(J) Can we? This requires proof.*), which will have size $g$. Cutting $\gamma$
   leaves a size $g - 1$ non-separating curve system for $\Sigma - \gamma$. It is maximal because if it weren't, and we could add another curve $\gamma'$ which
   is not pairwise homotopic with the other curves of the system, and cannot be slid to the boundary, then $\gamma'$ cannot be homotopic with $\gamma$ in $\Sigma$,
   and we have a size $g + 1$ non-separating curve system, a contradiction. Thus, the surface $\Sigma - \gamma$ is always of type $(g - 1, b + 2)$.

   --------------------

   Placing a simple curve $\gamma$ on a surface $\Sigma$ with genus $g$, boundary number $b$, and then removing $\gamma$ to create $\Sigma - \gamma$ will have one of two effects:

   1. It is non-separating, and will create a new surface with genus $g - 1$ and boundary number $b + 2$, so type $(g - 1, b + 2)$.
   2. It will separate the surface into two new surfaces of type $(g_1, b_1)$ and $(g_2, b_2)$ such that $g_1 + g_2 = g$ and $b_1 + b_2 = b + 2$.

   We have reduced the problem of classifyinng all simple curves on a surface to classifying all /separating/ simple curves on a surface.

   *(J): I still need to finish this part, I don't quite understand where we get that the number of all such homeomorphism classes is $3g - 3 + b$ yet.*

* Generic curves on surfaces
   
   Now, we broaden our perspective: let us consider curves that are possibly /non-simple/ (i.e. they can wind around themselves many times/they are non-injective). Given
   two curves $\alpha$ and $\beta$ is surface $\Sigma$, let $i(\alpha, \beta)$ denote the geometric intersection number between the curves: the number of times the two
   curves share a common point on $\Sigma$.

   We begin with the simplest example: the torus.

   *Claim.* The collection of all isotopy classes of closed curves in the torus are parameterized by $\mathbb{Q} \cup \{\infty\}$.

   /Proof./

Suppose we can separate $Y \cup A$ as $U$ and $V$ open in $Y \cup A$. Suppose neither $U$ nor $V$ are contained in $A$: then both intersect $Y$.
It follows that $U \cap Y$ and $V \cap Y$ are open in $Y$ and separate it, a contradiction to the connectedness of $Y$.

Thus, suppose without loss of generality that $U$ open in $Y \cup A$ is contained entirely in $A$, which is open in $X$. Note that $U$ is open in $A$ when $A$ is a subspace,
so $U$ is open in $X$. Moreover, $V$

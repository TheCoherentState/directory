The idea is to construct a sequence

Let $r_n$ denote the first $n$ decimals points of $\sqrt{2}$, which is rational. Clearly, $r_n \rightarrow \sqrt{2}$, where each $r_n$ is rational and $\sqrt{2}$ is rational. Suppose $U$ contains $A$,
and thus all $r_n$. It follows that for each $n$, we can choose some $B_n = [r_n, a_n) \times [-r_n, b_n)$, where $a_n > r_n$, which is contained in $U$. Moreover, there exists some $B = [\sqrt{2}, a) \times [-\sqrt{2}, b)$
which is contained in $V$, where $a > \sqrt{2}$ and $b_> -\sqrt{2}$.

Clearly, $b > -r_N$ for some $N$, by nature of the fact that $-r_N \rightarrow -\sqrt{2}$.

* Introduction

  Welcome to my work-in-progress book on differential geometry and topology. I will keep this page updated with the different sections
  as I construct them.

* Chapters

** Part 0: Topology crash-course

** Part 1: Basics of differential geometry

- Manifolds, maps between manifolds
- Tangent space and the tangent bundle, differential forms
- Integration on manifolds, Stokes' theorem

** Part 2: Algebraic topology and differential geometry

** Part 3: Riemannian geometry

** Part 4: Complex geometry

** Part 5: Current topics in geometry

   /The goal of this section is to outline current research topics in differential geometry/

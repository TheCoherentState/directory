\title{Some thoughts on discrete non-commutative geometry}
\date{\today}

\maketitle

\section{Introduction}

\noindent The purpose of these notes is to write down a few ideas related to discretizing certain structures in non-commutative geometry.

\section{Notes}

\noindent The main ingredient which catalyzes Connes' formulation of non-commutative geometry is Gelfand duality:

\begin{theorem}[Gelfand]
  There is a contravariant equivalence of categories between \catname{Top}
\end{theorem}
\noindent This duality also has a special case particular to differential geometry
\begin{theorem}

\end{theorem}
Expanding the category $\Cstarcat$ to $\Cstarcat$, the category of all possibly non-commutative $C^{*}$-algebras,
and attempting to similarly expand \catname{Top}$_{\catname{lc}}$

\end{document}

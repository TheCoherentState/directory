-----------------

I have recently begun work on a new overly-ambitious project: doing every exercise in the first three chapters of Hartshorne before my PhD begins in the Fall.
I was inspired by [[https://math.berkeley.edu/~cjdowd/hartshorne.html][this website]]. I don't even think this individual accomplished their goal, and I may not either (the odds are good). However, as the adage goes,
"shoot for the stars, land on the moon" or something corny like that.

[[../pdf/hartshorne.pdf][Here]] is a link to my solutions. I'll keep a tally of my progress here:

- Chapter 1 problems completed: 6/XXX
- Chapter 2 problems completed: 1/XXX
- Chapter 3 problems completed: 0/XXX

If I have any extra thoughts of notes about particular problems, I will add them below. Suggestions and/or corrections are much much appreciated, I'm sure there will be typos!
